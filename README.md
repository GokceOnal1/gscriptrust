# Overview
This is a programming language that takes inspiration from various other languages, mainly Javascript.
The ultimate goal for this language is for me to able to code my own language WITHIN this language!
This should be challenging but very fun.
# Features
While there are some bugs, this language supports:
- Mathematical expressions
- Defining and calling functions
- Defining and using variables
- While loops
- If/else if/else statements
- Classes (which are called 'blueprints')
- Instantiating classes to create objects
- N-dimensional lists and indexing for those lists
# Future
The primary focus going forward will be to implement methods and properties of primitive types.
For example, ```string.indexOf( \ something \ )```.

Looking ahead to the distant future, I want to write a graphics library for GScript (it will be based
on the Piston game engine for Rust)
# Other
Nothing for now...
